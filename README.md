ðŸ“‘ Internal Docs Q&A Agent 

An AI-powered assistant that helps teams instantly find answers from internal documents (Notion, Google Docs, Confluence, etc.) with a smart fallback to Groq LLM when no relevant document is found.

ðŸš€ Why we built this

Employees waste time searching across multiple tools for answers to company policies, workflows, or updates.
This bot makes it as easy as asking a question in plain English:

If the answer exists in internal docs â†’ it shows the snippet directly.

If not â†’ it falls back to Groq LLM for a general answer.
